    "## What is Probing?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probing** is an interpretability technique to understand what information is encoded in different layers of a neural network. We train simple models (probes) to predict specific targets from the network's internal representations. If a probe can successfully predict a target, it suggests that information is encoded in those representations. Note that when training probes, the aim is to not maximize on accuracy but reflect the true information content in features, and hence you should not overparameterize your classifier. \n",

    "**Key Questions**:\n",
    "- What phonetic information is captured at each layer?\n",
    "- How does the model's understanding evolve from acoustic to phonetics through the layers?\n",
    "- Can we identify speaker-specific patterns in the features?"

    "**Objective**: Analyze how well Hubert features capture **speaker identity** using t-SNE visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaker embedding analysis investigates how well neural network representations capture speaker-specific information. Unlike phonetic or acoustic features that focus on linguistic content, speaker embeddings capture the unique characteristics that distinguish one speaker from another, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Voice characteristics**: Fundamental frequency (F0), vocal tract length, speaking rate\n",
    "- **Speaking style**: Prosody, rhythm, intonation patterns  \n",
    "- **Physiological features**: Age, gender, accent, regional variations\n",
    "- **Behavioral patterns**: Individual speaking habits and preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task Overview**: In this task, you will implement a **speaker embedding analysis** to understand how speaker identity information is encoded across different layers of the Hubert model. You will extract audio features from 20 speakers and compute mean-pooled Hubert features from for each layer, and use t-SNE dimensionality reduction to visualize how well different layers separate speakers in the feature space. Your goal is to investigate whether different layers of the model contain varying amounts of speaker information, and if so, how this information is distributed across the model's depth. You'll analyze t-SNE plots for all 13 layers to understand how Hubert's internal representations evolve from speaker-agnostic to speaker-specific information. This experiment will help you understand how Hubert balances linguistic content with speaker identity across its layers.\n"
